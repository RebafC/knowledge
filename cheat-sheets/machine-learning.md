## Classification

### Naive Bayes Classifier

Assuming that a statement probability of being of a certain type depends if this type is more likely
and if the statement contains more words of this type.

#### How it works

1. "learning" types:
   * count the total number of documents
   * count how many times a word from a statement occurs for a given type
2. "guessing" types:
   * calculate type probability: count of documents of this type / total count of documents
   * calculate statement type probability: for each words in the statements
     * calculate word type probability: count occurence of this word for this type / total number of words
     * multiply all word type probabilities
   * calculate likelihood: multiply type probability by statement type probability
   * the statement is likely being of the type that has the highest likelihood
