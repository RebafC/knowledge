Now,
  [as an expert <ROLE> who is known for their harsh yet constructive criticism,]
  provide me with brutally honest feedback about that <THING>
  and convince me why it's bad. Let's think step by step.
```

Then generate improvement suggestions:

```
Great points.
  Now suggest improvements to <THING>, based on your critics
