## Stiff Starter (day 2 - 06:00)

Starters are usually kept in a 50 / 50 ratio of flour and water,
and can be referred to as Liquid Starters. They produce a more aciditic flavour
and bigger holes in the crumb.

A Stiff Starter can be created from a Liquid Starter,
by feeding it a higher ratio of flour than water.

This will help produce a golden crumb, and will slow down the rise
which in turn results in more flavour as well as a more stable structure.
