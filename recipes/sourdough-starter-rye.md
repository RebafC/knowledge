# Rye Sourdough Starter

A Sourdough Starter is a culture of bacteria, created and maintained by mixing
flour and water. Once ready, this _levain_ (another word for sourdough starter)
will contain natural yeast which will produce carbon dioxyde by consuming the
starch in the flour, making the dough rise. But most importantly, it will also
contain lactobacillus, which produces lactic acid that kills all other bacteria
(except for yeast) and giving the dough a tangy taste.

When used in bread, in addition to the rising actor, sourdough starter provide
a complex flavour, a moist crumb and an extended shelf life (a week or so).

Having no gluten, Rye Sourdough Starter will have the consistency of a wet
paste. Its bacteria develops quite easily so there's no need for kickstarter
ingredients (such as fast action yeast, sugar or diced organic fruit).

Once started, store this levain in a fridge: it can then stay there untouched
for a month. A day before being used, it will need to be taken out of the fridge
and fed a mixture of 50% rye flour and 50%, the total amount being equal to the
quantity that will be used. Once that day over, that amount of starter can be
extracted from it to be used in a recipe, and the starter can go back to the
fridge.

If the starter doesn't need to be used for longer than a month, it can be
frozen. A week before being used, take it out of the freezer and feed it
once a day.

Signs that the levain is healthy are bubbles indicating the yeast is active,
a lightly alcoholic smell hinting that the lactobacillus is working, and
after being fed it should double in size.

Starters are quite resilient, forgetting to feed it, feeding it the wrong
amount or the wrong flour won't kill it: resuming regular feeding will usually
fix the issue. If a dark liquid (hooch) starts to appear at the top,
discard the liquid and give the starter a feed.

This recipe ends up with a 500g levain, however there's no need to keep that
much. If it's going to be used once a week for a recipe that calls for a 20g of
starter, then 490g can be discarded and 10g kept
(a day before the recipe, it can be fed 5g of rye flour and 5g of water).

## Ingredients

* 250g rye flour (5 x 50g)
* 250g tapid water (5 x 50g, tap water is fine)

## Method

1. Day 1: In a 1L jar, mix 50g of rye flour with 50g water.
   Cover the jar (but not air tightly as the production of gas might break the
   jar) and leave it at room temperature.
2. Day 2: Add 50g of rye flour and 50g of water to the jar, mix it
   cover and leave it at room temperature.
3. Day 3: Add 50g of rye flour and 50g of water to the jar, mix it
   cover and leave it at room temperature.
4. Day 4: Add 50g of rye flour and 50g of water to the jar, mix it
   cover and leave it at room temperature.
5. Day 5: Add 50g of rye flour and 50g of water to the jar, mix it
   cover and leave it at room temperature.
6. The starter is now ready! Discard as much as you want
   (the discard can be used in a recipe),
   close the jar air tightly and store in the fridge.
